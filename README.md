Chemical Components Analysis Project..

Content-Based Cosmetic Product Recommendation System

I developed a content-based recommendation system focused on cosmetic products, specifically moisturizers for dry skin, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. The project aimed to help users discover alternative cosmetic products based on ingredient similarity, enhancing transparency and personalized skincare choices.

Key features of the project:

Data Collection: Scraped and processed ingredient lists of moisturizers from Sephora. Preprocessing: Tokenized and standardized ingredient data to create a document-term matrix for product comparison. Dimensionality Reduction: Applied t-SNE for visualizing ingredient similarity between products. Cosine Similarity: Used cosine similarity to calculate and rank ingredient-based similarity between cosmetic products. Visualization: Developed interactive visualizations using Bokeh to help users explore and compare products based on their ingredient composition. Impact: Provides users with the ability to make ingredient-conscious decisions and discover cost-effective alternatives, promoting informed skincare choices.

Tools & Technologies: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, t-SNE) Cosine Similarity, NLP, t-SNE Bokeh for interactive visualizations Data Source: Sephora (web-scraped product data)
